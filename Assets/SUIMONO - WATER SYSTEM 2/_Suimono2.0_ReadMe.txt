INSTALLATION
-------------
I. IMPORT SUIMONO BASE FILES INTO YOUR PROJECT

Go to: "Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package..." in the Unity Menu. Then select the
"Suimono_watersystem_v2.x.unitypackage" file.  This will open an import dialog box.
Click the import button and all the Suimono files will be imported into your project list.

A Note about Demo Content... The Suimono installer file contains a large number of files for the advanced demo scene.  If you don’t need this scene in your project, you can disable importing the demo content by unchecking the SUIMONO - WATER SYSTEM 2/_DEMO folder in the import dialog window before importing.


II. ADD THE SUIMONO MODULES TO YOUR SCENE

1) drag the "Suimono_Module" prefab located in the "/PREFABS" folder into your scene list.
2) If it isn't set already, make sure to set the Suimono_Module's position in the transform settings to 0,0,0
3) set the 'Unity Version Target' setting on the Suimono_Module object accordingto your Unity setup.
4) drag the "Suimono_Surface" prefab into your scene list.  This is your water surface.
5) Select what Surface Type you want the water to be... Flat, 3d Waves, or Infinite Ocean.

That's it for the basic installation!  You can now position “SUIMONO_Surface” anywhere in your scene that you like, and even rename the “Suimono_Surface” object to anything you wish. This object can also be scaled to fit your scene, but please see the scale note below!

More in depth installation and setup instructions, as well as a helpful FAQ can be found in the full documentation PDF, available on our website here:

http://tanukidigital.com/suimono/documentation


A Note about Scale:
If you're using the "infinite ocean" setting on the Suimono_Surface object, you should keep the Suimono_Surface scale to (10,1,10).  When you play your scene it will automatically zoom to fit your horizon threshold.  For all other surface objects the X and Z scale can be changed to whatever fits your scene, however the Y-scale should be kept at "1.0".  

A Note on Pink Water:
If you're getting a pink water plane, this is because the correct shader for your system/setup isn't loading. Make sure to go to the Suimono_Module object in your scene and set the "Unity Version Target" attribute according to your Unity system. 

A Note about Console Errors under DX9:
If you're running Unity in dx9 mode, you'll likely see console errors appear from time to time relating to "dx11" or "d3d" instructions.  This is happening because Suimono includes dx11 versions of it's shaders, but Unity in dx9 mode doesn't understand some of the code in these shaders.  To fix this go to the Suimono 2/Shaders folder, and remove all shader files that have "dx11" in their name.  This should remove the console errors, and you can always reimport them in the future if you ever need them.

Upgrade Note:
Version 2.0 has been almost completely redesigned, as such it will be installed in it’s own folder in your project hierarchy.  If you have any previous versions of Suimono in your project, it’s recommended to remove these first before installive Suimono 2.0.

If you’re upgrading from a previous 2.0 version, normally you can simply install the update on top of the current installation.  In some rare cases this overwriting does cause some errors.  In these cases it is recommended to delete the suimono 2 folder from your project entirely, and then install the new version.

A Note about Presets:
Saved Preset information is contained in text data files under "SUIMONO - WATER SYSTEM 2 / RESOURCES /".  If you have presets that you’d like to save make sure to backup these files before applying any updates, just to make sure your data isn’t overwritten.  You can then simply replace the new data file with your saved file.


----------------------------
CUSTOMIZATION NOTES
----------------------------
Defining your Scene Camera
Suimono tracks a scene camera in order to determine when to initiate the underwater switch. By default Suimono will track the scene camera object that has it’s object tag set to “MainCamera”. However, you can customize which camera Suimono tracks by changing the “Scene Camera Object” attribute on the Suimono_Module objects settings before running your scene.  If you're game is designed around a 3rd person controller, you'll want to designate your character object as the "Scene Track Object"... otherwise for most first-person games, the scene track object would be the same as the scene camera object.


Completely rewritten (and automated) Preset Manager
The Preset Manager has been completely rewritten to be simple to use and automatic. No more copying and pasting code! You can select a preset simply by clicking on it in the list. The “+NEW” button will create a new preset at the bottom of the list, and will fill this preset with the current settings. You can overwrite settings on a preset by pressing the “+” button next to that preset, and delete a preset entirely by pressing the “-” button. You can also rename a preset by pressing the small round button to the left of the preset name, entering the new name, then pressing OK (or X to cancel).

                     - NEW - Improved underwater rendering for Android and iOS.  Uses full fog and reflection renderer.
                     - CHANGE - Consolidating vertex shader code into new SuimonoFunctions.cginc library.
                     - CHANGE - Added new "Performance Settings" options to the Suimono Module Object.
                     - CHANGE - Dynamic Reflections now work on mobile by default.  There is a new option to disable Dynamic reflections in the performance settings.
                     - FIX - Dynamic Reflection texture link to main shader was broken.  Now the reflection Object successfully feeds the generated texture to the Surface Shader.
                     - FIX - Blurring now functions correctly on surface object and underwater.

ver.2.0Beta02 - CHANGE - Separated SuimonoObject component and mesh/rendering object for performance reasons.  Surface render is now a child of the master Surface object.
                     - FIX - Automatic Shader switching depending in Unity version and Target Platform.
                     - FIX - general Implicit errors in some preset return functions.
                     - FIX - Unity 4.3 loading wrong UI in Android mode.

ver.2.0Beta01 - Initial Beta Release!
